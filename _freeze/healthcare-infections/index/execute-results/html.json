Then, approximate $LOI$ with\n\n$$E[LOI] = 1 / P(LOI_\\text{pps} = 1).$$\n\nFor small sample sizes, results has shown this is biased, so we use a mixture of this estimator and the empirical mean.\n\n## Estimation methodology {.smaller}\n\n#### Step 3: Estimation of population incidence\n\nCalculate population incidence as\n\n$$I_{\\text{pop}} = I \\times N_{\\text{discharges}}.$$\n\nFor us, $N_{\\text{discharges}} = 3,713.513$, which is 60% of the total admissions in the year.\n\n::: {.fragment}\nThis is one of the few pieces of data Australia has that the ECDC doesn't!\n:::\n\n## Estimation methodology {.smaller}\n\n#### Step 4: Stratification by age and sex\n\nUse a multinomial likelihood with a Dirichlet prior, with weights taken from the number of cases in each age/sex category.\n\nA psuedocount is added to each strata ($0.001\\sum \\text{weights}$) to ensure likelihood can be calculated with empty strata\n\n::: {.fragment}\nThis psuedocount almost surely induces bias, and there are better techniques out there.\n:::\n\n## Estimation methodology\n\n#### Step 5: Adjustment for life expectancy\n\nUse the McCabe score, which gives the life expectancy according to severity of disease. Patients are categorised as:\n\n* non-fatal\n* fatal (life expectancy 3 years)\n* rapidly fatal (average life expectancy of 0.5 years)\n\nThese scores, combined with disease outcome trees, give DALYs and deaths.\n\n## Disease outcome trees\n\n![](images/outcome-tree.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Key results {.smaller}\n\n::: {.r-stack}\n\n|         | Number of HAIs <br> (95% CI)         | Deaths <br> (95% CI)        | DALYs <br> (95% CI)             |\n| ------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------- |\n| **SSI** | 44,238 <br> (31,176 - 73,797)        | 876 <br> (617 - 1,263)      | 13,197 <br> (9,298 - 19,001)    |\n| **UTI** | 42,408 <br> (25,200 - 68,735)        | 729 <br> (259 - 1,772)      | 16,087 <br> (5,939 - 37,218)    |\n| **CDI** | 5,125 <br> (2,360 - 10,740)          | 262 <br> (13 - 836)         | 2,757 <br> (241 - 8,655)        |\n| **HAP** | 51,499 <br> (31,343 - 82,877)        | 1,904 <br> (462 - 4,430)    | 39,276 <br> (17,608 - 77,915)   |\n| **BSI** | 23,979 <br> (15,658 - 36,245)        | 3,512 <br> (1,874 - 6,075)  | 46,773 <br> (26,205 - 79,104)   |\n| **All** | **170,574** <br> (135,779 - 213,898) | 7,583 <br> (4,941 - 11,135) | 122,376 <br> (85,136 - 172,784) |\n\n::: {.fragment style=\"background-color: white; border: solid thick red; padding: 10px;\"}\nThat's 1 in 20 _admissions_ resulting in an avoidable infection!\n:::\n:::\n\n## Key results\n\n::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width='50%'}\n![](images/Figure1-cases_per_100k.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n::: {.column width='50%'}\n![](images/Figure4-dalys_per_100k.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n:::\n\n## Key results\n\n![](images/Figure2-cases_stratified_per_100k.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Key results\n\n![](images/Figure3-deaths_per_100k.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Novelty\n\n* First estimate of HAI burden in Australia using (relatively) robust survey data in an established framework\n* Based on first point prevalence survey since 1984\n\n* There is no routine surveillance of HAIs in Australia\n* Point prevalence surveys remain the only way to understand the burden of these conditions\n\n## Summary\n\n* 498 DALYs per 100,000 is a large amount\n    * Motor vehicles: 180 DALYs\n    * Infectious diseases: 370 DALYs\n    * Respiratory diseases: 1380 DALYs\n\n::: {.fragment}\nThis work has informed guidance on HAI surveillance in Australia, including new funding schemes to better understand these conditions.\n:::\n\n::: {.fragment}\nAnd all this based on just 2767 patients from 19 hospitals...\n:::\n\n# HAIs are largely preventable.\n\nThey represent great opportunity for improvement, and we have a long way to go to prevent them entirely.\n\n# Carbapenemase-producing enterobacterales colonisation status does not lead to more frequent admissions: a linked patient study {.smaller}\n\nD.
